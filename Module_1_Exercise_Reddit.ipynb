I think it is a good idea (since the mask asset already exists on the pink chroma) is to add the facemask option to each of the other chromas as a toggle-able feature (similar to Kai'sa's helmet) where you can choose a)eyemask or b)facemask. The facemasks would be the same design as the pink kennen but with a different colour.\\n\\nPictures:\\n\\nKennen with facemask [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/POFAUT4.png)\\n\\n[https://imgur.com/POFAUT4](https://imgur.com/POFAUT4)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nKennen with  eyemask [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pcWYrkF.png)\\n\\n[https://imgur.com/pcWYrkF](https://imgur.com/pcWYrkF)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd you could toggle the mask on or off with \\\\[Control\\\\]\\\\[5\\\\]\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSome example ideas for the facemasks:\\n\\n* \\\\-default: plain green matching lab coat\\n* \\\\-pink: already has mask\\n* \\\\-red: red or black\\n* \\\\-orange: orange or lime green\\n* \\\\-rainbow: rainbow or white\\n* \\\\-dark blue: any shade of blue\\n* \\\\-black: grey or black\\n* \\\\-light blue: light blue\\n* \\\\-purple: purple or blue\",\n",

Additionally, if a team is really far ahead, they have more seiging power to end the game since 2 lanes worth of minions funnel into 1 tower. \\n\\nI think that the surrender option ends the game just as the winning team is having fun. And since it only takes 4 votes, someone who wants to try and come back cannot stop the vote themselves. \\n\\nThe devils advocate arguement I can think of is that one team snowballs too hard after winning X number of events and there in no chance of coming back. If this is the case maybe the kill gold or xp during events needs to be tuned so that the losing team doesn't get 2k gold behind, lose xp, and not have the reward.
